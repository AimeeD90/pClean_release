Title: Preprocess high-resolution tandem mass spectra prior to database searching
Version: 0.1.0

Description: pClean is a novel algorithm to preprocess high-resolution 
  tandem mass spectra prior to database searching, which integrated three modules, 
  removal of label-associated ions, isotope peak reduction and charge deconvolution, 
  and a graph-based network approach and aimed at filtering out extraneous peaks 
  with/without specific-feature. pClean is supportive to a wide array of instruments 
  with all types of MS data, and incorporative into most data analysis pipelines.
